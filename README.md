# trees-to-tree

Single decision trees are more interpretable than alot of more complex models such as gradient-boosted decision trees, but these more complex approaches are more accurate in alot of circumstances.

In this notebook demonstrate how you can fit a decision tree on the outputs of a boosted tree to produce a model with accuracy close to that of the boosted tree but much more interpretable.
